SYSTEM CALLS
The system call table (syscalls/syscall.dat) is constantly changing, using
skewed versions is _very_ likely to give you segfaults and strange behaviour.
For this lib you should use the same version of elksemu.
The system call table will only be frozen when the linux-86 kernel is
running and reasonably stable. The 386 version is using a distinct list 
that matches the Linux-i386 syscall list.

THE COMPILER
You should use the versions of bcc, unproto, as86, ld86 and elksemu that
are in this version of the combined development environment. Some other
versions will work but often they'll just appear to work or not work at
all. The original bcc-cc1 won't pickup the right header files, the
original ld86 won't generate COM files or 386-Linux files and looks in
the wrong place for crt0.o and libc.a. The original as is just plain
broken!

Main Subdirectories.

bcc		Lots of BCC helper functions
bios		Minimal 'system' calls for standalone executables.
error		The C error functions.
getent		Routines for /etc/group, /etc/passwd and /etc/utmp
gtermcap	GNU termcap
i386fp		BCC's floating point routines for 386 code.
include		Some include files, some new others Glib or Glib hacked.
kinclude	Kernel include files, here for now.
malloc		Malloc routines
misc		Various larger functions
msdos		This is the syscall directory for msdos.
regexp		Standard regular expression parser
stdio		Robert's standard I/O
string		The functions for string.h
syscall		All the system call functions, and some tied lib ones.
termios		Termimal mode control.
time		Unix time related functions.

Directory structure:

      The top Makefile will try to call any "Makefile" it finds in a
      subdirectory, so to add a new chunk to "libc.a" just drop in
      the directory a Makefile that understands "make clean" and
      "make libc.a" (Which must also update ../libc.a)
      There's now a tiny script (New_subdir) that'll do this.

      Make config will look in all subdirectories for a file 'Config'
      any it finds will be displayed and can be used to switch a directory
      on or off.

      The exit(rv) function is already defined. It will call the contents
      of the function pointer (*__cleanup)() before it calls _exit();
      This pointer should be used through the 'atexit' or 'on_exit' lib
      functions. (See standard man pages)

      If you need to call something before main see the file 'Pre_main'.
