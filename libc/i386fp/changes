fcomp:
Fixes for negative 0 (perhaps this shouldn't be generated, like denormals
and infinities (these would cause even more trouble) but Fsub routine or
something generated one).

frexp.x:
Deleted 3rd arg (used to return value when bcc wasn't doing it right).

Fixed frexp(value = 0) and ldexp(value = 0) returning nonzero.

Most files:
Changed comment symbol to '!' for new assembler (not the native ';' in
case this is ported to ACK someday).

Avoided using ebp and unnecessary register saves.

Changed assembler style to make it a bit more portable or like I do it
(no '$' for hex, 8[esp] instead of [esp+8], use only .define and not export
or .globl, use '#' (could use nothing) instead of '*' for immediate).
The partly-supported 8(ebp) and .globl would be still more portable.

Changed terminology 'mantissa' to 'fraction'.

Round to even. Required for 'paranioa' not to find any defects.

Used preprocessor.

Parametrized most of the magic numbers. Phew!

Supported denormals. Now 'paranioa' doesn't find any flaws.
