This is currently a very cutdown version of the syslib.

This also currently does nothing about the difference between 'TEXT' and
'BINARY' modes but I think that this level of operation should be pure
binary, the 'TEXT' mode is more suited to stdio where an "fopen(f, "rb")"
is more reasonable and probably won't break on other OSs.
