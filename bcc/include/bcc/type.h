/*
 * A type is essentially a "constructor", a size, and a list of pointers
 * leading to a scalar type.
 * The type constructors are codes for the scalar types and (), [], *,
 * struct and union.
 * The scalar types are char, short, int, long, float and double.
 * The type lists are triply linked.
 *
 * Part of the type structure might look like
 *
 *              int        (int)
 *               =
 *       func <-------> int        (int ())
 *        |            =
 *         --> ptr <--> int        (int *)
 *
 * (the exact structure depends on the order of declarations).
 * This layout results from the pre-declared (int) and (int ()) followed by
 * a declaration using (int *).
 * The sideways link (from func to ptr here) allows all types leading to a
 * given type to be found.
 * This allows different declarations of (int *) to be recognised as the same.
 * Type equivalence is equality of type pointers.
 *
 *
 * flags for scalar types
 * up to 3 of the flags may be set (none for constructed types)
 * the 2nd and third flags can only be UNSIGNED or DLONG
 * UNSIGNED only applies to integral types
 * DLONG only applies to long and unsigned long types and says that these
 * are actually longer than an int
