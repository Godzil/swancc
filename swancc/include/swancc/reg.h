/*
 * The compiler generates "addresses" of the form
 *     indirect(indcount) (rx + offset)
 *
 * where:
 *     rx is a machine register (possibly null)
 *     n is the indirection count (possibly 0)
 *     offset is a constant.
 *
 * It does not support more complicated formats like
 *     indirect(indcount) (rx + index * scale + offset).
 *
 * The register is coded as bit flag in the  storage  component of
 * the symbol structure. This allows groups of registers to be tested
 * using bitwise "&". Throughout the compiler, the group of these bit
 * flags has the type  reg_t. If there are only a few registers, reg_t
 * can be an uint8_t. It must be unsigned if the high bit is
 * used, to avoid sign extension problems. For bootstrapping the compiler
 * from a compiler with no uint8_t, the unsigned type should be
 * used instead (with a signifigant waste of storage).
 *
 * The bit flags should really be defined as ((reg_t) whatever) but
 * then they would not (necessarily) be constant expressions and couldn't
 * be used in switch selectors or (worse) preprocessor expressions.
 *
 * The CONSTANT and GLOBAL (non-) register bits are almost
 * equivalent. A constant with nonzero indirection is marked as a
 * GLOBAL and not a CONSTANT. This makes it easier to test for a constant
 * CONSTANT. Globals which are formed in this way are converted to
 * constants if their indirection count is reset to 0 (by & operator).
