Hello again,

And one hint for using the optimizer I sent you in an earlier mail: the
order of the rules files matters! You should try:

copt -c! -h"use16 386" rules.start rules.386 rules.86 rules.end

If you don't want to optimize for 386 long integer operations, you
can leave out the -h option and the rules.386 file. The rules.net file
is only necessary for my bootrom code, and does some optimizations I
can't do with preprocessor commands.

gero.
