Fri Jun 11 13:08:27 BST 1999 Robert de Bath (rdebath@poboxes.com)

	* objdump86 program included.

	* Updated for libc6

	* As86 fixes for multi-segment (The linker can't really cope tho)

Sat Mar 13 16:45:42 GMT 1999 Robert de Bath (rdebath@poboxes.com)

	* Vsn 0.15.0, more documentation!

	* Linker can now generate QMAGIC 386 executables.

Fri Jul 31 09:33:18 BST 1998 Robert de Bath (rdebath@poboxes.com)

	* version 0.14.4, This package is based on the ELKS dev86 package
          of the same version number.

	* Improved documentation (There's actually a man page!)

   	* The linker will produce either Linux-8086, DOS-COM 
	  or Native Linux-386 OMAGIC executable files.

   	* The assembler has many instruction fixes:
     	   jmp near, jmpi dword x,y, org, use32/use16 ... etc
          and can also read source from stdin. 

  	* Assembler macros work.

	* The assembler command 'include' works.

	* Conditionals and string conditionals work.

	* Various additions for multi-segment work.

   	* The assembler can create bare binary files with simple ASCII symbol
   	  files, these are ideal for generating encapsulated binaries and a
   	  simple script for doing this is included.

	* The assembler will generate warning messages when 386
	  instructions are used with the assembler in an 8086 mode.

	* Many minor bug fixes and portability fixes.
