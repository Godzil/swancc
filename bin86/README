This is a simple assember and linker for 8086 - 80386 machine code.
There have been a large number of changes since bin86-0.4 so I strongly
suggest you read the manpages.

To install:
   make PREFIX=/usr install
or
   make PREFIX=/usr/local install

This version has been tested under Linux, older versions were also tested
and working under SunOS and AIX.

-------------

This is based on the as86 and ld86 distribution written by Bruce Evans.
Bruce has released this under the GPL and the changes I've made are 
also under the same license

The BCC components that were distributed in this package are now in
the dev86 package along with a working C compiler and libc for 8086
ELKS, DOS and standalone code.

The most recent address I have for Bruce is <bde@FreeBSD.org>
