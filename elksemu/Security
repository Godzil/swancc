The install scripts now install /lib/elksemu as a suid-root executable.
This gives two additional facilities when running elks executables.

1) It is now possible to run programs that are execute only, without
   read permission, as the file is opened while we have superuser
   access.

2) If the ELKS executable has suid or sgid bits set these will be honoured.

The user now needs execute access to run an executable, this is checked.

If the executable does not have either suid/sgid bits set then all
extra permissions will be dropped within the first few lines of the
main() function. Because of this you need only check this tiny
piece of code if you intend never to use suid.

If you have any problem with elksemu being suid-root the program will
run as before, with no complaints, if you remove the suid permission.
